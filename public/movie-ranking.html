<h1>The Best Movies According to PRASHANT</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>the crime elements are peripheral and there's more humor than one might find in a typical thriller.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p> The idea of time dilation due to gravity on the behemoth planet, wormholes, and even the black hole shown was ahead of its time.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value</p>
